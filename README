Various small twisted snippets.


liblo
--------------------
Integrates a pyLiblo server into the twisted main event loop and thus allows
one to use pyLiblo in twisted without threads.
Liblo is the lightweight OSC library.

bluez
--------------------
Integrates a pyBluez RFCOMM socket into the twisted main loop and thus allows
to connect to Bluetooth RFCOMM devices without the need of an extra thread
running pyBluez (or some other bluetooth library).

lirc
---------------------
A python-only implementation of a lirc-client. It directly connects to a
running lircd instance via it's UNIX domain socket. There is no need for
pylirc or a lircrc file. Keypresses are returned as defined in the lircd.conf
file.

I wrote them for my use and my purposes, so they may lack some features or may
not have been thoroughly tested.

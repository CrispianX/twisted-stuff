Various small twisted snippets.


liblo
--------------------
Integrates a pyLiblo server into the twisted main event loop and thus allows
one to use pyLiblo in twisted without threads.
Liblo is the lightweight OSC library.

bluez
--------------------
Integrates a pyBluez RFCOMM socket into the twisted main loop and thus allows
to connect to Bluetooth RFCOMM devices without the need of an extra thread
running pyBluez (or some other bluetooth library).

I wrote them for my use and my purposes, so they may lack some features or may
have some bugs I didn't catch.
